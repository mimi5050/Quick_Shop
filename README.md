The QuickShop website is a comprehensive e-commerce platform designed to streamline online retail operations for both administrators and customers. Built on a robust database backend, the website offers seamless functionality across various user roles. Users are greeted with a user-friendly landing page (index.php) upon accessing the website. From here, they can navigate to different sections based on their role and requirements.

For administrators, the website provides a suite of tools accessible through dedicated admin pages. These include managing orders (manage_orders.php), order details (manage_orderdetails.php), users (manage_users.php), and products (manage_product.php). These pages offer administrators full control over the database, allowing them to efficiently handle sales transactions, user management, and product inventory.

For customers, the QuickShop website offers an intuitive interface for browsing products, placing orders, and managing their profiles. Key customer pages include the homepage (Customer-Homepage.php) for product discovery, profile view and editing (Customer-profile.php) for personalized experiences, order placement (Customer-SearchProducts.php), order history tracking (Customer-OrderHistory.php), and login details management (Customer-EditLogin.php). Additionally, sales managers and inventory managers have dedicated dashboards (sales_dash.php and inventory_dash.php) for overseeing sales and inventory operations respectively, along with access to relevant tables for managing orders and products.
